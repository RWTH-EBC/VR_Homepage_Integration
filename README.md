# VR_Homepage_Integration

Within this environment we integrate Virtual Reality (VR) in our Webpage of Urban Energy Lab - Helena. 

This is the first version: https://rwth-ebc.github.io/VR_Homepage_Integration/

For VR programming we use Unity to export it as HTML code. This code runs on the original web page later on.

This Unity Project is compiled with WebGl.
You get the Folder "Build", "TemplateData" & the file "index.html".
After publishing this repository, the aforementioned Link is created.
To integrate this on the original web page we use a IFrame Html Tag.

HowTo

You can use:

Mouse Cursor to control the camera in X and Y - direction
Arrows / WASD to move in X and Z- (horizontal und vertical) - direction 
Space bar to start security events in case of a leakage of propane
