# VR_Homepage_Integration

Within this environment we integrate Virtual Reality (VR) in our Webpage of Urban Energy Lab - Helena. 

This is the first version: https://rwth-ebc.github.io/VR_Homepage_Integration/

For VR programming we use Unity to export it as HTML code. This code runs on the original web page later on.
